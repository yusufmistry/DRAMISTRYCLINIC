          <i>Prognathism</i>, from the Greek pro, "forward" and gnathos, "jaw",
          is a dentofacial deformity of varied causes, (although with a large
          genetic component). This malformation is described by the presence of
          an anteroposterior discrepancy between the jaw and the upper jaw, that
          is, both bone structures are misaligned with each other. <br />

          In cases of mandibular prognathism, the jaw is developed by excess in
          relation to the maxilla and the inferior dental arch extends forward
          beyond the superior, causing a Class III malocclusion, also known as
          underbite. <br />

          Class III skeletal malocclusion with a prognatic jaw is one of the
          most serious maxillofacial deformities, although it is important to
          underline that this is considered a disorder only if it affects
          mastication, speech or social function due to a great aesthetic
          imbalance.

            <p style="font-size: 1.2rem">
              Prognathism is considered a malformation of eminently genetic
              causes, although its etiology is still multifactorial. Thus, a
              combination of inheritance and environment can enhance or decrease
              malocclusion. <br />

              Among the environmental factors involved, we can mention oral
              habits, hypertrophy of tonsils or adenoids, premature loss of
              temporary teeth, endocrine alterations, etc. <br />

              According to these factors, the malformation manifests itself in
              different ways:
            </p>

            <ul style="font-size: 1.2rem">
              <li>
                When the jaw bone shows abnormal excess growth (mandibular
                hyperplasia) with respect to the maxilla, known as skeletal
                class III.
              </li>
              <li>
                When the prominent jaw is due to a dental problem, that is, when
                the teeth are misaligned with each other.
              </li>
              <li>
                When the patient has an excess of the chin, he may have a
                prognata appearance, although strictly speaking it is not a
                Class III.
              </li>

              TREATMENT OF MANDIBULAR PROGNATISM

              The modification of facial growth by dentofacial orthopedics can
              be an effective method to resolve skeletal discrepancies of the
              Class III jaw in growing children. If prognathism is diagnosed in
              adulthood, and depending on where it occurs, there are different
              treatment options:
            </p>
            <ul style="font-size: 1.2rem">
              <li>
                For a class III that is only dental, the indicated treatment is
                orthodontics, although it is important to mention that a
                functional cross-bite preserved over time can become skeletal,
                hence the importance of early treatment.
              </li>
              <li>
                For an overdeveloped chin (an apparent prognathism, but no class
                II maloclussion), the treatment consists of a mentoplasty or
                chin reduction surgery
              </li>
              <li>
                For a class III skeletal malocclusion, orthognathic surgery is
                necessary: <br />
                • Bimaxillary surgery, when the maxillofacial surgeon needs to
                intervene surgically on the mandibular and maxillary bone <br />
                • Monomaxilar surgery, when the maxillofacial surgeon only acts
                on one of the two skeletal structures.
              </li>
            </ul>

              WHY TREAT MANDIBULAR PROGNATISM OR CLASS III
            </h3>

            <div style="font-size: 1.2rem">
              The common characteristic that defines both a prominent lower jaw,
              and a retracted upper jaw, is that in both cases the patient has a
              Class III dental malocclusion, that is, the lower teeth are in
              front of the upper teeth, a condition that transmits certain
              hardness and aggressiveness to the facial features of patients
              with this type of problem. <br />

              The solution of the mandibular or class III prognathism solves
              functional problems, such as discomfort when chewing, pain in the
              temporomandibular joint (TMJ), and even improves the patient's
              diction (which in many cases presents with lisp). In addition,
              after the intervention, a great aesthetic improvement is also
              achieved: the facial features become softer, finer and more
              harmonious, eliminating the psychological obstacles of having a
              facial deformity.
