          <b>Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA)</b> is a disorder consisting of
          repeated episodes of pauses in breathing during sleep, known as
          apnoeas, normally lasting for more than 10 seconds. The main cause of
          obstruction is the collapse of the walls of the upper airway. <br />
          Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) affects just over 25% of the population
          and has a negative effect on the quality of life of sufferers. Not
          only does it disturb their rest during the night, which, in extreme
          cases, could even lead to death, but also their daily activity,
          accompanied by drowsiness and chronic fatigue. Even more serious
          still, <b>Sleep Apnea</b> causes a reduction in oxygen transported by
          the blood, resulting in arterial hypertension, cardiovascular disease,
          metabolic and hormonal alterations and an increased risk of accident.

              Diagnosis of Sleep Apnea is carried out by means of a test called
              a <i>polysomnography</i>, which monitors several variables during
              sleep, using special devices. This test is carried out by the
              Neurophysiology team, and being a multidisciplinary disorder, the
              <b>maxillofacial surgeons</b> have to coordinate with the entire
              team of specialists, which usually includes neurologists,
              neurophysiologists and otolaryngologists.

              There are normally four levels of action in the treatment of
              Obstructive Sleep Apnea:
              <ol>
                <li>Weight loss</li>
                <li>CPAP (Continuous Positive Airway Pressure)</li>
                <li>Mandibular advancement splints</li>
                <li>Orthognathic Surgery</li>
              </ol>
              One of the treatments recommended for many years has been CPAP
              (Continuous Positive Airway Pressure), which is a device worn at
              night, consisting of a mask connected to a machine which pumps in
              pressurised air to prevent the collapse of the patient’s airways.
              Most patients who have suffered from Sleep Apnoea describe the
              CPAP as a “horrendous” machine. Intolerance to the noise and the
              mask, nasal congestion and irritation of the mucous membranes make
              70% of patients want to stop using the CPAP and find a more
              comfortable and effective alternative. Mandibular advancement
              dental splints constitute a diagnostic element and a temporary
              solution for less serious cases of Sleep Apnea. According to
              recent studies, prolonged use of this splint can cause alteration
              of the bite and deterioration of the temporomandibular joint.
              However, thanks to the continuous dedication and intense research
              into Obstructive Sleep Apnea, the specialists at the Maxillofacial
              Institute, along with other international groups, have
              scientifically demonstrated that orthognathic surgery provides a
              definitive solution to this serious problem in patients with
              dentofacial deformities. See article:
